# RPABlock

RPABlock is a Python-based project that combines Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and blockchain technology. It provides a framework and tools to automate repetitive tasks and securely store the automation logs on a blockchain network. The project aims to enhance transparency, auditability, and data integrity of automated processes by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.

## Features

- RPA automation: Automate repetitive tasks and workflows using Python libraries like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, or Blue Prism.
- Blockchain interaction: Interact with blockchain networks (e.g., Ethereum) using the web3.py library.
- Secure logging on the blockchain: Store automation logs securely on the blockchain.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/liangzheyu9/RPABlock.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Install the RPA platform of your choice (e.g., UiPath, Automation Anywhere, Blue Prism).
- Configure your blockchain connection settings in the `config.py` file.

## Usage

1. Customize the `automation.py` script to define your RPA workflows. Use the provided functions and methods to automate tasks and generate automation logs.

```python
from automation import Automation

automation = Automation()

# Example: Automate a workflow
def automate_workflow():
    automation.login('username', 'password')
    automation.perform_task1()
    automation.perform_task2()

# Run the automation workflow
automate_workflow()
Customize the automation workflow based on your specific requirements and the tasks you want to automate using your chosen RPA platform.

Use the blockchain_interaction.py script to interact with the blockchain:

from blockchain_interaction import BlockchainInteraction

blockchain = BlockchainInteraction()

# Example: Store automation logs on the blockchain
logs = ['Log 1', 'Log 2', 'Log 3']
transaction_hash = blockchain.store_logs(logs)

# Example: Retrieve automation logs from the blockchain
stored_logs = blockchain.retrieve_logs(transaction_hash)

# Customize the blockchain interactions based on your requirements.
Update the script with your blockchain connection settings and customize the interactions based on your automation logs and requirements.
